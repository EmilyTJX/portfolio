                        <div>Reflection: Overall, I was able to expand my field of knowledge and gain a better insight
                            to what robotics software engineers engage in. I enjoyed my ATAP journey with KLASS and am
                            grateful for the patience of the team and its learning culture. I am thankful to be given
                            the opportunity to be involved in both backend and GUI aspects of the project, to be able to
                            explore and expand my knowledge in the different pipelines Robotics revolves around.
                            Furthermore, I was able to complete my initial defined objectives, with greater
                            self-initiative in terms of being curious and diving into terms and fields I am unfamiliar
                            with. I was also more proactive in seeking help from the other team members, developing the
                            clarity of my thought process before asking questions.
                            Through this internship, I was able to discover a greater interest in the
                            robotics backend. My understanding and impression has changed drastically. Through the daily
                            standups and
                            reviews, I was awed by the different research and testing done by the seniors as well as
                            the different application and thought process given to each project. </div>

                            need to swap tutorials or lab session before the nus modrec. The user can input his current
                            class to be swapped, as well as the target class
                            that he wish to swap with. Swappie will provide a list of matching requests to the user,
                            hence providing a
                            fast and convenient swapping experience. When the match is found, the student will be
                            informed through the website's notification, to contact the other student.</p>

                        <p> This project focuses more on the ideation aspects in tackling the lack of attention and
                            emergency aid provided towards elderly care.
                            We propose to utilise technology that leverages on the user’s movement data to detect
                            possible falls or accidents, and mobilise Community First Responders (CFRs), through the
                            existing myResponder application to quickly attend to these elderly. We can thus seize this
                            ‘golden hour’ to provide earlier intervention, by alerting CFRs of the elderly’s emergency
                            needs 24/7 without someone being physically there.

                <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In my free time, I would be
                    playing racket sports. My go-to sport would be Badminton, followed by Squash. I'm always looking
                    forward to picking up new skills, as well as the the camaraderie built with equally passionate
                    players.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of romance and fantasy genre movies and
                    television shows and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology
                    advancements in the web development world.</p>
